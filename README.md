# Sudoku Solver
### Susie Mueller

## Objectives

In this project, you will implement a Sudoku puzzle solver using a stack-based depth-first search algorithm. You’ll build an interactive Board class, implement methods for checking validity and solution status, and create a Sudoku class that solves puzzles while visualizing the solving process. You'll also explore how the number of initial locked cells impacts the complexity of solving a board.

## Goals

- Design and implement a Board class that supports reading and validating Sudoku puzzles.
- Create a Sudoku class that uses depth-first search and a stack to solve puzzles.
- Visualize the puzzle-solving process using a GUI with live updates.
- Experiment with varying numbers of starting values to study their effect on search time and solvability.
- Develop optimized strategies for choosing the next cell based on remaining valid options.


## Tools & Libraries

- Java – primary programming language
- Stacks – to support depth-first search and backtracking
- Graphics (Java AWT/Swing) – for visualization with LandscapeDisplay
- Random – to generate puzzles with random initial values
- JUnit or manual tests – for testing solver correctness
